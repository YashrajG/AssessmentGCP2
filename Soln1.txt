Initialising VPC:
1. On the VPC main page, click create VPC. Add name, description.
2. Select subnet creation mode as custom, fill the details for subnet including CIDR as 10.0.0.0/29. Click Create.

5. Create a bastion host for testing:
	Create another GCE instance in the same subnet with an external IP. Add a network tag as 'bastion-host'
	Create a firewall rule with source IP range 0.0.0.0/0 and target tags as 'bastion-host'


Private Instance:
6. Create another instance in the same subnet adding 'no-ip' to network tags and setting external IP to none.
7. In VPC -> Routes, create a new route with:
	network as created above
	destination as internet (0.0.0.0/0)
	Priority 800 (less than the default 1000)
	tags add 'no-ip'
	Next hop -> 'Specify an instance'
	instance as the nat gateway created above
8. Create a firewall rule with source tags as 'bastion-host' and target tags as 'no-ip'

9. From the bastion host, ssh into the private instance and check if it is connected to the internet:
	curl example.com
	It shows Failed error

10. Create NAT Gateway:
    Go to the Cloud NAT page in the Google Cloud Platform Console.
    Click Get started or Create NAT gateway.
    Enter a Gateway name of nat-config.
    Set the VPC network to custom-network1.
    Set the Region to us-central1.
    Under Cloud Router, select Create new router.
        Enter a Name of nat-router.
        Click Create.
    Click Create.

11. From the private instance, again check if it is connected to the internet:
	curl example.com
	It shows HTML file.
